## EventKit Rails

EventKit Rails is a Ruby on Rails port of [EventKit](https://github.com/sendgrid/eventkit), an open source project to receive notifications for [SendGrid's Event Webhook](https://sendgrid.com/docs/API_Reference/Webhooks/event.html). This project can be deployed to a rails server, or quickly deployed to [Heroku](http://heroku.com) using the "Deploy Heroku Button" (see below).

## Tech Stack

EventKit Rails uses [Ruby on Rails](http://rubyonrails.org) for the backend, including ActiveRecord and Postgres for the production database. The backend is API driven, which is used by the [EmberJS](http://emberjs.com) frontend.  The frontend also uses [Ember Data](http://emberjs.com/guides/models/) to handle the communication between the frontend and backend.

## Deploying To Heroku

You can easily deploy EventKit Rails to your Heroku account with a few clicks using the button below. If you don't currently have a Heroku account, you can [set one up for free](https://www.heroku.com/pricing) on their website.
